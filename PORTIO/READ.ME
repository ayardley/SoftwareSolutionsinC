In this directory you will find the header file "ttyio.h", which is
common to all versions of the portable i/o library.  The directories
"msdos", "os2" and "unix" contain o/s specific sources.  The "unix"
directory contains subdirectories "alarm", "ioctl" and "select" for
unix-based solutions built around different facilities.
