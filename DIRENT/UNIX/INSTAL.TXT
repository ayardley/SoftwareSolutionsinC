The following instructions are for systems resembling Research UNIX, with hints
about dealing with variations you may encounter for your specific system.
Installation should be done only by someone who is comfortable with modifying
the standard C library and header files.

If your system already includes directory access routines that refer to "struct
direct" instead of "struct dirent", you should replace them with this package.
(We're trying to get this standardized; see the discussion in the NOTES file.)
On the other hand, if your system already has <dirent.h>, you should simply use
the existing facilities instead of this package.

I have tried to make the source code as generic as possible, but if your system
predates Seventh Edition UNIX you will have problems.

DISCLAIMER:  Although I believe the code and procedures described here to be
correct, I make no warranty of any kind, and you are advised to perform your
own careful testing before making any substantial change like this to your
programming environment.


0)  For antique systems that do not support C's "void" data type, edit the file
    sys/dirent.h to add the following:

	typedef int		void;	/* good enough for government work */

    If for some reason your <sys/types.h> doesn't define them, add the
    following to sys/dirent.h:

	typedef unsigned short	ino_t;	/* (assuming original UFS) */
	typedef long		off_t;	/* long is forced by lseek() */

    None of this should be necessary for any modern UNIX system.

1)  Copy the file dirent.h to /usr/include/dirent.h and copy the file
    sys/dirent.h to /usr/include/sys/dirent.h.  (The file sys/bsddir.h is also
    provided for the BRL UNIX System V emulation for 4.nBSD.  That environment
    uses different directory names for everything.)

2)  Copy the file direct.man to /usr/man/man3/directory.3 and copy the file
    dirent.man to /usr/man/man5/dirent.5; edit the new file
    /usr/man/man3/directory.3 to change the "SEE ALSO" reference from dirent(4)
    to dirent(5) and to change the 3C on the first line to 3; edit the new file
    /usr/man/man5/dirent.5 to change the 4 on the first line to 5; then print
    the manual pages via the command

	man directory dirent

    to see what the new routines are like.  (If you have a "catman" style of
    on-line manual, adapt these instructions accordingly.  Manual entries are
    kept in directories with other names on some systems such as UNIX System V.
    On systems that already had a directory library documented in some other
    manual entry, remove the superseded manual entry; if the description of the
    native filesystem directory format found by "man dir" refers to a directory
    library, modify it to simply refer to the entry for "dirent".)

3)  Copy the files clodir.c, opedir.c, readir.c, rewdir.c, seedir.c,
    and teldir.c to the "gen" or "port/gen" subdirectory of your C library
    source directory.  If you do not have a getdents() system call, copy the
    file getden.c to the "sys" or "port/sys" subdirectory and copy the file
    getden.man to /usr/man/man2/getdents.2 (actually you may prefer to put this
    file in section 3 and adjust the references in the other manual entries
    accordingly; also adjust the references to dirent(4) to be to dirent(5) if
    that's where the entry is).  If you have a getdents() system call but it
    might not be supported on some target systems, rename it to _getdents() and
    make sure that "UNK" is defined when compiling getden.c.  Edit the C
    library makefile(s) to include the new object modules in the C library.
    (See the comments at the beginning of getden.c for symbols that must be
    defined to configure getden.c.)  Then remake and reinstall the C library.
    Alternatively, you can just compile the new sources and insert their
    objects near the front of the C library /lib/libc.a using the "ar" utility
    (seedir.o should precede readir.o, which in turn should precede
    getden.o, which should precede _getdents.o if you are using that).  On
    some systems you then need to use the "ranlib" utility to update the
    archive symbol table.

4)  After the C library has been updated, delete /usr/include/ndir.h or any
    other header used with a previous directory library to prevent inadvertent
    use of the superseded directory access interface.  Also delete any
    corresponding library such as /usr/lib/libndir.a.

5)  A sample Makefile (named "mkfile") is included that automates much of the
    above, but you will need to tailor it to your specific environment.

6)  To verify installation, try compiling, linking, and running the program
    tstdir.c.  This program searches the current directory "." for each file
    named as a program argument and prints `"FOO" found.' or `"FOO" not found.'
    where FOO is of course replaced by the name being sought in the directory.
    Try something like

	cd /usr/bin			# a multi-block directory
	$WHEREVER/tstdir . FOO lint BAR f77 XYZZY

    which should produce the output

	"FOO" not found.
	"lint" found.
	"BAR" not found.
	"f77" found.
	"XYZZY" not found.

    A more thorough test would be

	cd /usr/bin			# a multi-block directory
	$WHEREVER/tstdir . `ls -a` | grep 'not found'

    This program does not test the seekdir() and telldir() functions.

7)  Notify your programmers that all directory access must be made through the
    new interface, and that documentation is available via

	man directory dirent

    Make the NOTES file available to those programmers who might want to
    understand what this is all about.

8)  Change all system sources that were accessing directories to use the new
    routines.  Nearly all such sources contain the line

	#include <sys/dir.h>
    or
	#include <ndir.h>

    so they should be easy to find.  (If you earlier removed some other header
    file, that is, if this package superseded an earlier version of the
    directory access library, look for its name too.  See the conversion
    instructions in the NOTES file.)
