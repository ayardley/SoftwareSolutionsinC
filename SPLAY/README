This directory contains all source for the splay tree routines
discussed in "Software Solutions in C".  It includes the library code,
the example program presented in the text with some test data, and
another standalone demo/test program.  The Makefile is written for
POSIX-like systems.

The program "spexamp" is the example as presented in the book.  The
makefile target "runex" will run it against the "exdata" file supplied
and compare it against the known-to-be-good "excanon" result file.
The Bourne shell/AWK program "genex" can be used to generate other
data sets, or to recreate "exdata" if necessary.

The program "spplay" lets you type things in and see what happens.  It
comes with a "genplay" program that will turn a UNIX password file
into a series of tests that show ordering and proper operation of the
delete function.  The "runplay" target in the Makefile will make a
"pdata" file using "genplay", and feed that into "spplay".  The
internediate results are (of course) highly dependant on your password
file, but the last "e" print of entries should have no output as
everything was supposed to have been deleted.
