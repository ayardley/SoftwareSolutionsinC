Usage: hashtest [init_size]

Reads from stdin; inserts each word read into a hash table; if that
word is already there, then deletes it from the hash tables.

By default, it just prints out the final contents of the hash table
(i.e., a list of all words that appear an odd number of times in the
input).

If all components are compiled with -DDEBUG, this will dump all the hash
table contents and collision indicators after each step.  It will also
check for words that begin with the following characters:
  -	Try to delete the word (minus the "-") and report result
  +	Insert the word (minus the "+") using the HASHdup operation
  ?	Just look up the word (minus the "?") and report result
  !	Look for a duplicate word (minus the "!") and report result (HASHnxt)
You can test the HASHdup function with input like "dup +dup ?dup !dup !dup"
